### The benefits of hardware compositing:
- Compositing page layers on the GPU can achieve far better efficiency
than the CPU (both in terms of speed and power draw) in drawing and
compositing operations that involve large numbers of pixels. The hardware is
designed specifically for these types of workloads.
- Expensive readbacks arenâ€™t necessary for content already on the GPU
(such as accelerated video, Canvas2D, or WebGL).
- Parallelism between the CPU and GPU, which can operate at the same time
to create an efficient graphics pipeline.
